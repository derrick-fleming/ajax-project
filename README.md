# My Villagers

A web application for Animal Crossing fans who want to see and keep notes on their favorite villagers.

## Why I built this

Having enjoyed playing Animal Crossing New Horizons throughout the pandemic, I always wanted a tool where I could easily track which villagers I've had and which ones I've collected their photo. It was challenging for me to remember, especially if it had been several weeks between playing the game. This application was inspired by my desire to easily track and collect that information.
